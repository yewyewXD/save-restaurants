# Eatery Malaysia

## Motivation

During the COVID pandemic, food businesses are not doing well in my home country, Malaysia, and they are forced to go online. Many of them use third-party food delivery software like GrabFood and FoodPanda, but they can't bear the mandatory commission fee charge by those softwares.

As a passionate developer and problem solver, I can't stand seeing my people struggling. Therefore, I teamed up with a good friend from Malaysia, Azib (who is in charge of the marketing and content creation) to start building this software that helps digitalize restaurant businesses <b>for 100% FREE</b>.
